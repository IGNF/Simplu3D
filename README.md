Simplu3D
============

A library to automatically general built configuration that respect urban regulations and optimize a utility function.


Introduction
---------------------

This research library is developed as part of [COGIT laboratory](http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/cogit/accueilCOGIT.php) researches concerning processing of urban regulation. 

It provides an implementation of multi-dimensionnal simulated annealing algorithm to produce built configuration from a set of boxes constrained by urban regulation that optimizes a utility fonction. 

The project is developed over 3D GIS Open-Source library [GeOxygene](http://oxygene-project.sourceforge.net) concerning geometric operators and 3D visualization, [librjmcmc4j](https://github.com/IGNF/librjmcmc4j) for simulated annealing implementation and [simplu3d-rules](https://github.com/IGNF/simplu3d-rules) for geographical model and regulation management.

Conditions for use
---------------------
This software is free to use under CeCILL license. However, if you use this library in a research paper, you are kindly requested to acknowledge the use of this software.

Furthermore, we are interested in every feedbacks about this library if you find it useful, if you want to contribute or if you have some suggestions to improve it.

Library installation
---------------------
The project is build with Maven and is coded in Java (JDK 1.7 is required), it has been tested in most common OS. If you are not familiar with Maven, we suggest installing developer tools and versions as described in [GeOxygene install guide](http://oxygene-project.sourceforge.net/documentation/developer/install.html).

Test class
---------------------
fr.ign.cogit.simplu3d.exec.BasicSimulator class using predefined resource  files is runnable. It generates a built composed by a set of intersecting boxes.

```Java
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    //Loading of configuration file that contains sampling space information and simulated annealing configuration 
    String folderName = BasicSimulator.class.getClassLoader()
        .getResource("scenario/").getPath();
    String fileName = "building_parameters_project_expthese_3.xml";
    Parameters p = Parameters.unmarshall(new File(folderName + fileName));

    //Load default environment (from simplu3d-rules)
    Environnement env = LoadDefaultEnvironment.getENVDEF();

    //Select a parcel on which generation is proceeded
    BasicPropertyUnit bPU = env.getBpU().get(8);

    //Instantiation  of the sampler
    OptimisedBuildingsCuboidFinalDirectRejection oCB = new OptimisedBuildingsCuboidFinalDirectRejection();

    
    //Rules parameters
    //Distance to road
    double distReculVoirie = 0.0;
    //Distance to bottom of the parcel
    double distReculFond = 2;
    //Distance to lateral parcel limits
    double distReculLat = 4;
    //Distance between two buildings of a parcel
    double distanceInterBati = 5;
    //Maximal ratio built area
    double maximalCES = 2;

    //Instantiation  of the rule checker 
    SamplePredicate<Cuboid, GraphConfiguration<Cuboid>, BirthDeathModification<Cuboid>> pred = new SamplePredicate<>(
        bPU, distReculVoirie, distReculFond, distReculLat, distanceInterBati,
        maximalCES);

  
    //Run of the optimisation on a parcel with the predicate
    GraphConfiguration<Cuboid> cc = oCB.process(bPU, p, env, 1, pred);

    
    //Witting the output
    IFeatureCollection<IFeature> iFeatC = new FT_FeatureCollection<>();
    //For all generated boxes
    for (GraphVertex<Cuboid> v : cc.getGraph().vertexSet()) {

      IMultiSurface<IOrientableSurface> iMS = new GM_MultiSurface<>();
      iMS.addAll(GenerateSolidFromCuboid.generate(v.getValue()).getFacesList());

      IFeature feat = new DefaultFeature(iMS);
      //We write some attributes
      AttributeManager.addAttribute(feat, "Longueur",
          Math.max(v.getValue().length, v.getValue().width), "Double");
      AttributeManager.addAttribute(feat, "Largeur",
          Math.min(v.getValue().length, v.getValue().width), "Double");
      AttributeManager.addAttribute(feat, "Hauteur", v.getValue().height,
          "Double");
      AttributeManager.addAttribute(feat, "Rotation", v.getValue().orientation,
          "Double");

      iFeatC.add(feat);

    }

    
    //A shapefile is written as output
    //WARNING : 'out' parameter from configuration file have to be change
    ShapefileWriter.write(iFeatC, p.get("result").toString() + "out.shp");

    System.out.println("That's all folks");


  }
